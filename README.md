## Description

This is the main repository of our Data Analysis and Management system for ALS research. Our framework aims to deal with the new challenges that ALS researchers are facing nowadays . Indeed Genetic technology is advancing rapidly. We now have the ability to quickly and cheaply collect huge amounts of genetic information, and because of close collaboration between research groups, to do this in tens of thousands of people. How to store, handle and easily share this information might represent overwhelming challenges. The aim of our DANM framework is to make all members of our research community able to deal with these aspects of our research in order to speed up our studies, make them more reliable and reproducible.
In this repository we provide instructions and tools to set up the data management and analysis framework in a few easy steps both as local deployment and as dokerized/Singularity deployment.

## Project plan

We are implementing a solution that will enable sharing, analysing and storing of each of the 1-4 levels of omics and associated data: Level 1 data refers to the data in its raw, non-normalised form, levels 2 and 3 represent data at different stages of processing and level 4 represents summary results data (https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/Data+level#Datalevel- DataLevelClassification).
A number of different challenges and requirements exist when considering each level. For level 1-2 data a file system such as iRODS (Integrated Rule-Orientated Data system,https://www.irods.org/) can be used, whereas Level 3 and 4 data, along with the clinical data, will be loaded into a knowledge platform such as tranSMART(http://transmartfoundation.org). 

### Development of iRODS file storage system for level 1-2 data

iRODS is an integrated Rule-Oriented Data System, developed to build distributed storage infrastructure. Several iRODS servers in different locations can share their data through automatic mechanisms based on internal rules. But iRODS is also useful to provide users with a remote storage area supporting large files, large numbers of files and identity management. Although we propose to centralise data for this project, it provides us with the capability to build a federated system if this is preferred by the ALS stakeholder advisory group. The approach will enable us to handle diverse data types, provide controlled fine grained access controls, add/remove data/users/partners/different infrastructure. It is being widely adopted by institutes such as the BROAD Institute and Sanger Centre for managing highly dimensional data, typical of modern genomic datasets and is particularly important as these datasets are not managed well by standard relational database management systems.
iRODS allows to deal with distributed network of data repositories as the ALS research network. Throw data federation it would allow an easy data access and sharing across the international research community favouring collaborations. In this repository we provide instructions and tools to set up an iRODS data management system in a few easy steps.

We also provide a set of ALS research specific microservices/rules to allow the researcher to exploit iRODS metadata and rule engine services (work in progress)

[An iRODS data browser](https://github.com/KHP-Informatics/MNDA-DataManagement-System/tree/master/irods-cloud-browser-1.0.1-RELEASE) is available at the address http://52.202.127.9:8552/irods-cloud-frontend/ 
This browser allows to log in and explore any iRODS zone. The following credentials allow to log in into a sample iRODS zone based onto Rosalind (our King's/MRC HPC cluster)

### Development of TranSMART open source knowledge platform for level 3 and 4 data, with integration of clinical information

The TranSMART system is a platform for translational medicine comprising a relational database back end and a web based interface that integrates a large number of open source bioinformatics tools for analysis and visualisation, including GenePattern for expression analysis, Plink for genetic analysis, Galaxy, R and add on statistical packages (box plot with ANOVA, Fisher test, k-means clustering and others). The system, originally developed by Johnson & Johnson and based on i2b2 technology, has recently been released under an open source license and is being widely adopted and developed by the open source community. It is the tool of choice for many EU projects integrating clinical and omics datasets across Europe and beyond. This platform will provide general user access to processed data and will enable cohort selection and analyses on the fly. For example, it allows a user to select a subset of patients, filtered on clinical and phenotypic variables such as age, gender, age of onset and genotype, then perform an analysis such as a differential expression analysis, or extract a subset a selection of genotypes and visualise the results.

## Data analysis and analysis reproducibility tools

Bioinformatics is speeding up genetic research showing great prospectives. Unfortunately due to the nature of this field, its tools and pipelines often lack in maintenance effort and user friendly interfaces. This might result in performance inconsistence among different versions of the same tool and unreliable availability of "old" tools stable versions. Moreover, their use and deployment often requires informatics skills way beyond the average user. This is particularly true in a medical/biology research environment as the ALS research is. This section wants to provide tools able to automatise the deployment and use of bioinformatics pipelines. 
We aim to develop a super user friendly interface for these tools (a web server) able to interactively create, using technologies such as Docker and Singularity, stand-alone and portable deployments of bioinformatics pipelines according to the user needs. (work in progress...) 

### NGSeasy

NGSeasy is a flexible and easy-to-use NGS pipeline for automated alignment, quality control, variant calling and annotation. The pipeline allows users with minimal computational/bioinformatic skills to set up and run an NGS analysis on their own samples, in less than an afternoon, on any operating system (Windows, iOS or Linux) or infrastructure (workstation, cluster or cloud).

### bcbio

A python toolkit providing best-practice pipelines for fully automated high throughput sequencing analysis. You write a high level configuration file specifying your inputs and analysis parameters. This input drives a parallel pipeline that handles distributed execution, idempotent processing restarts and safe transactional steps. The goal is to provide a shared community resource that handles the data processing component of sequencing analysis, providing researchers with more time to focus on the downstream biology.

## iRODS  

The following sections will give the user a quick how-to-get-started guide for iRODS. For more complete instructions and details please read either the iRODS [manual](https://docs.irods.org/4.2.0/) or this [tutorial](https://irods.org/uploads/2016/06/irods_beginner_training_2016.pdf)

**VERY IMPORTANT**: the following set up can be used for educational/fun deployments. For a production deployment a few tweaks are necessary. These can be found [here](www.tweaks.com)

### iRODS deployment (ubuntu)

An iRODS deployment, or Zone, is composed of at least an iRODS Metadata Catalog (iCAT) database. Here we will use PostgreSQL to implement an iCAT database.

Both iRODS software and PostgreSQL can be installed via the native operating systemâ€™s package manager. For Ubuntu, this is named apt

#### Installing and setting up the postgres iCAT database

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update   #update apt-get

$ sudo apt-get -y install postgresql    #install postgresql

$ sudo su - postgres    #switch to the postgres user

$ psql  #Start the PostgreSQL command console

> CREATE DATABASE "ICAT";   #create the iCAT database

> CREATE USER irods WITH PASSWORD 'testpassword'; #Create the database user account to be used by iRODS

> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "ICAT" to irods; #Give user account permission to use the database

> \q    #Log out the console

$ exit  #switch back to your user
```

#### Installing iRODS Software Packages

The first thing to do would be to install the RENCI repository that hosts the iRODS software and update apt
To be noted that this repository only has iRODS versions for ubuntu xenial (16.04), trusty (14.04) and precise (12.04). 

If you are using a different version please replace $(lsb_release -sc) with one of these three supported releases. E.g. if your ubuntu is 14.10, replace $(lsb_release -sc) with "trusty"

```bash
$ wget -qO - https://unstable.irods.org/irods-unstable-signing-key.asc | \ sudo apt-key add -

$ echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://unstable.irods.org/apt/ \ $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee \ /etc/apt/sources.list.d/renci-irods-unstable.list

$ sudo apt-get update

```

Then install the core server software:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get -y install irods-server irods-database-plugin-postgres
```

Finally set up your iRODS zone. After running the following script you will be asked a series of questions. Default values can be found in this [table](https://github.com/KHP-Informatics/MNDA-DataManagement-System/blob/master/Screen_irods.png) 

```bash
$ sudo python /var/lib/irods/scripts/setup_irods.py
```
### Installing iRODS using a bash script

If sudo privileges are owned, an iRODS iCAT server (irods 4.1.3) can be deployed very quickly using a bash script. 


```bash 
$ wget https://github.com/KHP-Informatics/MNDA-DataManagement-System/raw/master/irods_bash_installation.zip

$ unzip https://github.com/KHP-Informatics/MNDA-DataManagement-System/raw/master/irods_bash_installation.zip

$ cd irods_bash_installation

$ sudo ./irods_installation.sh

```
The responses for setup script can be found in /opt/irods/setup_responses 


### Dockerized iRODS

An iRODS iCAT server (irods 4.1.3) can be deployed very quickly using [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

Please follow the instruction you can find [here](https://github.com/KHP-Informatics/MNDA-DataManagement-System/tree/master/irods-docker)

### tranSMART deployment

Since TranSMART consists of multiple services, docker-compose is used to build images for the different services and manage the links between them [LINK](https://github.com/KHP-Informatics/MNDA-DataManagement-System/tree/master/transmart-docker). We recommend using docker and docker compose for the platform deployment.

## Docker/Singularity 

**Docker** is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. Using containers to deploy our system and creating our analysis environment would allow us to make our work independent by the machine we work on. This would improve the reproducibility of our science, the portability and reliability of our deployments and avoid any machine specific issues. For this reason working using containers isn't just recommended but also makes things easier. Since docker is widely used and maintained we recommend it as container technology to use if possible. Unfortunately Docker does require sudo privileges to run its containers making its use difficult on HPC facilities.

**Singularity** is also a container project similar to Docker and does not require sudo privileges to run. This can be very important if you decide to use our framework on a machine for which you do not have such privileges. E.g. your institution HPC cluster. In this case you create your docker deployment locally and then converting the docker image into a singularoty image using this [script](https://github.com/KHP-Informatics/MNDA-DataManagement-System/tree/master/docker2singularity)

```bash 
$ ./docker2singularity.sh  [-m \"/mount_point1 /mount_point2\"] docker_image_name
```
